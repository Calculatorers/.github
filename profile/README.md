## A Brief History of Calculators  

### 1. Ancient Tools (2000 BCEâ€“1600 CE)  
- **Abacus**: Invented in Mesopotamia and refined by the Chinese and Romans, this bead-and-rod system enabled basic arithmetic.  
- **Napierâ€™s Bones** (1617): Carved rods simplified multiplication for astronomers and merchants.  

### 2. Mechanical Calculators (17thâ€“19th Century)  
- **Pascaline** (1642): Blaise Pascalâ€™s gear-based adder/subtractor.  
- **Stepped Reckoner** (1694): Gottfried Leibnizâ€™s machine for multiplication/division.  
- **Difference Engine** (1822): Charles Babbageâ€™s programmable computation prototype.  

### 3. Electronics Take Over (20th Century)  
- **Curta** (1948): The first handheld mechanical calculator.  
- **TI-2500** (1972) & **HP-35** (1972): Pocket-sized electronic and scientific calculators.  

### 4. Digital Age (21st Century)  
- Graphing calculators (e.g., **TI-84**) dominate classrooms.  
- Web tools like [Calculatorers](https://www.calculatorers.com/) and apps (e.g., **Wolfram Alpha**) offer advanced computation.
